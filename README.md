# Library Management System Database

## Description
This project is a relational database design for a Library Management System. It includes tables for Authors, Books, Members, Loans, and Categories. The database enforces relationships such as many-to-many (Books-Authors, Books-Categories) and one-to-many (Members-Loans). Constraints such as primary keys, foreign keys, NOT NULL, and UNIQUE are used to maintain data integrity.
